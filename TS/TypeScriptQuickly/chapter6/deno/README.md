To run this sample app you'll need a [deno](https://deno.land) executable.
It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases).
Use following command to launch the app once you have deno downloaded (tested with v0.3.4):

```shell
./deno_osx_x64 index.ts
```

If you're getting permission denied on Mac OS,  run it like this:

```shell
chmod +x deno_osx_x64
./deno_osx_x64 index.ts
```
